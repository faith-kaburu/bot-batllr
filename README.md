# DESCRIPTION
# core deliverables
 * See profiles of all bots rendered in BotCollection.
 * Add an individual bot to my army by clicking on it.  * The selected bot should render in the YourBotArmy component.
 * The bot can be enlisted only once. The bot does    not disappear from the BotCollection.
* Release a bot from my army by clicking on it. The bot disappears from the YourBotArmy component.
 * Discharge a bot from their service forever, by clicking the red button marked "x", which would delete the bot both from the backend and from the YourBotArmy on the frontend.
